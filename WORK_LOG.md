|:---------|:-----------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Sept 2nd |  1-1:30pm   | The problem set was introducted to me in class and I learned about the game of ladders (never knew about it before!) |
| Sept 3rd | 7:30pm-8pm: |    I read through the problem set and started playing snakes and ladders to actually understand how the game worked. 
| Sept 3rd | 8pm-8:30pm  |  Played even more games (I won 3 of them somehow!). I now understand the topic that I will be coding soon |

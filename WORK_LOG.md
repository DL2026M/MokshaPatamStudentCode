| Sept 2nd |    1 - 1:30pm     |The problem set was introducted to me in class and I learned about the game of ladders (never knew about it before!). Mr. Blick started introducing ideas on how to approach the problem (he even gave us pseudocode!). I chatted with my peers on how to find the fewest rolls solution. |
| Sept 3rd |   7:30pm - 8pm:   |I read through the problem set and started playing snakes and ladders to actually understand how the game worked.I also reviwed my code from CS2 MazeSolver for Breath first search to make sure I fully understand it. In addition, I started brainstorming ways to keep track of the rolls for each solution. 
| Sept 3rd |   8pm - 8:30pm    |Played even more games (I won 3 of them somehow!). I now understand the topic that I will be coding soon. I also read through the google slides in class and the couple pages of material that he passed out in class about breath first search. |
| Sept 7th |  8:30pm - 9:15pm  |I started coding! My process involved following the sudo code given to us on the slides and coding any part that I knew how to do. I first created a queue of integers and a couple of int variables to know the current node and keep track of rolls. I then added the first node to the queue and then created a while loop that runs until the queue is empty (no nodes left to visit). |
| Sept 7th |  9:15pm-10:15pm   |During this work time, I started to figure out how to solve the problem, but still didn't know how to code my thoughts and make it abstract. I need to write code that checks to see if a node is either a snake or ladder and the minimum rolls needed to get there. I also need to keep track of each roll made in each solution in order to return the fewest amounts of rolls overall to win (if any). |
| Sept 8th |  8:00pm - 8:45pm  |I incorpated maps, which Mr. Blick just taught us today in class, in my program in order to have it where when you go to a snake or ladder, you don't check any of the nodes around you and instead go directly to where that snake or ladder ends. I also was able create 2 separate for loops that made it so if you rolled onto a snack or ladder, you would be automatically moved to where the snake/ladder put you. I tweaked some of my comments from my previous code to be more helpful. |
| Sept 8th | 8:45pm - 10:00pm  |During this time frame I finished my code and passed all of the tests; however, at first I failed all tests because my output was always -1. I managed to fix an if statement to only run if the current node was less than the total size of the board so that it would only return -1 if there was no solution. After passing all of the tests and removing a couple of variables that I didn't end up using, I added my final comments and will submit now! |
| Sept 8th | 10:00pm - 11:00pm |Took this time to really improve my work log and add a lot to my previous responses! |
